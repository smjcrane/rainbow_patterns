# rainbow_patterns
Generate some pretty pictures in python

This repository uses the python3 library drawSvg to draw some patterns of circles.
The coordinates used are cubic coordinates (description [here](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/))

## Usage
Put some coordinates in a text file (remember they must sum to 0 for each point)
run  `python3 rainbow.py <file.txt>`
